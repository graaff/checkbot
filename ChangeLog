	* checkbot: 
	Major rewrite of most of the internal routines. The routines are
	much more structured now, and broken up into smaller routines.
	I also changed the way checked links are remembered. It should be
	much less efficient, CPU-wise, but more efficient memory-wise.

	* checkbot:
	Fixed small problems, mostly with output.
	Fixed checking of external links
	Changed sorting order

	* checkbot: 
	Perl5 version now works for the most part. Although Checkbot isn't
	fully finished I at least feel confident to release it.

	* Made a start with the perl5 version of checkbot. The modules in
	perl5 (e.g. LWP) look very promising, and should make checkbot
	quite a bit better.
