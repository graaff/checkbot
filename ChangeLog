	* TODO: New file.

	* checkbot: Added single -x option as an additional exclude pattern.
	This overrules the -m match attribute.

	Removed this old perl4 version.

	* checkbot: 
	Major rewrite of most of the internal routines. The routines are
	much more structured now, and broken up into smaller routines.
	I also changed the way checked links are remembered. It should be
	much less efficient, CPU-wise, but more efficient memory-wise.

	* checkbot:
	Fixed small problems, mostly with output.
	Fixed checking of external links
	Changed sorting order

	* checkbot: 
	Perl5 version now works for the most part. Although Checkbot isn't
	fully finished I at least feel confident to release it.

	* Made a start with the perl5 version of checkbot. The modules in
	perl5 (e.g. LWP) look very promising, and should make checkbot
	quite a bit better.
