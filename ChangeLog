	* checkbot: Changed checked array to an associative array. Will
	consume more memory, but drastically cut back on lookup time.
	
	Rewrote handle_url logic to be more clear. Also fixed bug where
	servers would be added to the list unjustly.

	Sleep was only done on problem links, not after each request.

	Also added checks for already checked links while scanning through
	the document, and only add those links not checked to the queue.

	Add percentage problem links for each individual server.

Mon Apr 29 08:43:12 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: Deal with unknown or non-determinable server types.
	
	Only add links to the external queue when we know we can check
	their protocol.

	Additional changes to layout and content of pages.

Sun Apr 28 21:16:51 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: Added a number of patches by Tim MacKenzie
	Added -s option to set the seconds of sleep between requests.
	Remove work files when *not* debugging.
	Only compile -m and -x regular expressions once.
	Also check external ftp and nntp links (using HEAD only).
	Get rid of huge memory leak! (Also noted by Fabrice Gaillard)

Fri Mar 29 10:58:24 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:

	local files.

Sun Mar 24 18:01:05 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Added code to support regular expressions with the -m and -x
	arguments. Thanks to Thomas Thiel for the patch and suggestions.
	
	No strict checking on schemes, fixes problem with unknown schemes
	stopping checkbot. Thanks to Pierre-Yves Foucou.

	* checkbot: 
	Should create direcory for temporary files, and remove it
	afterwards. Noted by Steve Fisk.

Sat Mar 16 13:40:48 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Made a number of changes from or based on patches by Thomas Thiel:

	Added missing t option in Getopts string.

	Made -m argument optional. If not given, the -u argument is also
	used as the start argument.

	Temporary files are now created in a separate directory. Its name
	contains the PID of Checkbot, to allow several concurrent
	Checkbots being run. Also remove temporary files, unless
	debugging.

	Implement file:// scheme to allow direct checking (without HTTP
        server)

Fri Mar 15 11:06:13 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Fixed warnings (and in the process, a small bug as well).
	Added URL and proper name to help.

Sat Mar  2 11:51:45 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Added 'require 5.002' (because libwww-perl5b8 requires it).
	Added 'use strict', and fixed problems resulting from this. This
	can be seen as a first step towards fixing the huge
	memory-consumption.
	Updated help.

Tue Feb 27 09:57:57 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed bug which occured when -x option was not present.
	Updated script to use libwww-perl5b8 function names. This is not
	backward compatible with versions prior to beta 8.

Mon Feb 26 12:46:08 1996  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed bug with Referer header for external URL's.
	Also make server pages auto-refresh.

Sat Feb 24 11:48:15 1996  Hans de Graaff  <Hans.deGraaff@twi72.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* TODO: New file.

	* checkbot: Added single -x option as an additional exclude pattern.
	This overrules the -m match attribute.

Mon Dec 11 14:13:30 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* index.html
	Added libwww-perl5 address, and added a usage section.

	* checkbot.pl
	Removed this old perl4 version.

Fri Dec  8 13:41:43 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot: 
	Major rewrite of most of the internal routines. The routines are
	much more structured now, and broken up into smaller routines.
	I also changed the way checked links are remembered. It should be
	much less efficient, CPU-wise, but more efficient memory-wise.

Fri Nov 24 16:45:18 1995  Hans de Graaff  <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>

	* checkbot:
	Fixed small problems, mostly with output.
	Fixed checking of external links
	Changed sorting order

	* checkbot: 
	Perl5 version now works for the most part. Although Checkbot isn't
	fully finished I at least feel confident to release it.

Fri Aug 25 11:23:36 1995  Hans de Graaff  <graaff@is.twi.tudelft.nl>

	* Made a start with the perl5 version of checkbot. The modules in
	perl5 (e.g. LWP) look very promising, and should make checkbot
	quite a bit better.
