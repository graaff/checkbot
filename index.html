    <h1>Checkbot</h1>

    <p>Checkbot is a tool to verify links on a set of HTML
    pages. Checkbot can check a single document, or a set of documents
    on one or more servers. Checkbot creates a report which summarizes
    all links which caused some kind of warning or error.</p>

    <h2>Getting Checkbot</h2>

    <p>Current releases of Checkbot can always be found on <a
    href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">CPAN</a>, the Comprehensive Perl
    Archive Network. Currently the latest version is <a
    href="checkbot-1.61.tar.gz">Checkbot 1.61</a>.</p>

    <p>Changes in this version include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Updated Makefile.PL to include versions checked for.
      <li>Require URI 1.07 because of bug fixes.
      <li>Use GET instead of HEAD for confused servers.
      <li>Update email and web addresses.
    </ul>

    <p>Checkbot requires the following additional software, all of
      which is also available at CPAN:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>perl 5 (version 5.005 recommended)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/">LWP</a> (the
	  libwww-perl 5 module)</li>
      <li>Net::FTP</li> (available in the libnet package)
      <li>Mail::Send (optional, needed to use --mailto option,
          available in the MailTools package)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, it is recommended to always use the most recent version of
      these modules.</p>

    <h2>Brief overview</h2>

    <p>Checkbot collects all links from URLs matching the <code>match
    string</code>, and accessible through the <code>start
    url</code>. It has two categories of links: internal links (to
    other URLs matching the <code>match string</code>), and external
    links. The external links are filed for later use, while all
    internal links are checked.</p>

    <p>After checking all internal links Checkbot will check all
    external links found on the pages. It will <em>always</em> use the
    <code>HEAD</code> method for this. Checkbot does <em>not</em>
    adhere to the robots standard (which involves examining
    <code>/robots.txt</code> from a site first). However, people have
    brought some good arguments to my attention, so I will eventually
    implement this into Checkbot as well.</p>

    <p>After a interval (which gets exponentially longer) Checkbot
    will write its current results to a file. This file contains some
    statistics, such as number of links processed. It also contains a
    list of pages (sorted by server, and per server by page name)
    which contains links which generated an HTTP error code, along
    with that code.</p>
