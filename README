Checkbot -- a WWW link verifier

Checkbot is a perl5 script which can verify links within a region of
the World Wide Web. It checks all pages within an identified region,
and all links within that region. After checking all links within the
region, it will also check all links which point outside of the
region, and then stop.

Checkbot regularly writes reports on its findings, including all
servers found in the region, and all links with problems on those
servers.

Checkbot was written originally to check a number of servers at
once. This has implied some design decisions, so you might want to
keep that in mind when making suggestions. Speaking of which, be sure
to check the TODO file for things which have been suggested for
Checkbot.

Changes between version can be found in the ChangeLog file.

Making and installing Checkbot is easy:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

You will need to have the following Perl modules installed in order to 
properly install Checkbot:

    LWP
    Net::FTP (contained in the libnet package)
    Mail::Send (optional, contained in the MailTools package)

Problems, etc. can be reported to checkbot@degraaff.org
Checkbot is distributed at: http://degraaff.org/checkbot/

There is an announcement mailing list to which announcements of new

Note that this mailing list is behind a dialup line, so it may take up 
to a day for the confirmation request to reach you.
