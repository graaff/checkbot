Checkbot -- a WWW link verifier

Checkbot is a perl5 script which can verify links within a region of
the World Wide Web. It checks all pages within an identified region,
and all links within that region. After checking all links within the
region, it will also check all links which point outside of the
region, and then stop.

Checkbot regularly writes reports on its findings, including all
servers found in the region, and all links with problems on those
servers.

Checkbot was written originally to check a number of servers at
once. This has implied some design decisions, so you might want to
keep that in mind when making suggestions. Speaking of which, be sure
to check the to do file on the website for things which have been
suggested for Checkbot.

Making and installing Checkbot is easy:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

You will need to have the following Perl modules installed in order to 
properly install Checkbot:

    LWP
    URI
    HTML::Parser
    MIME::Base64
    Net::FTP
    Mail::Send (optional, contained in the MailTools package)

Problems, etc. can be reported to checkbot@degraaff.org
Checkbot is distributed at: http://degraaff.org/checkbot/

There is an announcement mailing list to which announcements of new
versions are posted. You can sign up for the list by sending mail to
checkbot-announce-subscribe@graaff.xs4all.nl
Note that this mailing list is hosted on my home machine, which is not
always online. It may take up to a day for the confirmation request to
reach you.

Changes in version 1.74 (17-Dec-2003)

    * New --suppress option allows Response code/URL combinations not
      to be reported as problems.
    * Checkbot warnings are now handled as pseudo-HTTP status messages
      so that they can make use of all Checkbot features such as
      --dontwarn.
    * Option --allow-simple-hosts is deprecated due to this change.
    * More robust handling of (lack of) status messages.
    * Checkbot now requires LWP 5.70 due to bugfixes in this release,
      although it should still also work with older LWP versions.
    * Documentation fixes.

Changes in version 1.73 (31-Aug-2003)

    * Checkbot now tries to produce valid XHTML 1.1
    * URLs matching the --ignore option are now completely ignored;
      they used to be checked but not reported.
    * Proxy support works again, but --proxy now applies to all links
    * Documentation fixes

Changes in version 1.72 (04-May-2003)

    * New statistics which should work correctly
    * Much simplified storage of information on problem links
